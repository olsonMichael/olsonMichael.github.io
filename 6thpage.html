    <h1>Digital Dilemmas </h1>
    <p>For the final project I am showcasing is my digital dilemmas project. This is a project in which I read an article about tattoos in sports games. I then answered 4 quadrants worth of questions, and then wrote a 10 word summary of the article. This appealed to me because I enjoy playing sports games, and I thought it was interesting how athletes don't own their tattoos, and videogame companies must spend a lot of money in order to show the tattoos in games. My 10 word summary for these articles was "Athletes don't own their tattoos, so a licensed agreement happens." </p>
    <li>Question 1- What is being digitized? How is the information represented digitally?

<li>Question 3-  What are the benefits and harms of digitizing this content?
</li>
<li>Question 4-  Is our world better or worse because of digital representation? </li>
