  <h1>Fishing Game CMU Create Task Number 2</h1>
<p>This is my second CMU Create Task. I was required to use one mouse event handler, a function, an IF statement, and one variable. A mouse event handler is something that occurs when you make an action with the mouse, such as pressing down the mouse button or moving it around. a function is used to draw a shape multiple times if the program doesn't already have a way to draw that specific shape. And example of this would be a drawFish function. The program is unable to drawFish without the program, and now you are able to draw multiple fish. An if statement is basically something that occurs if something is true and will skip over the program if that something is false. This can be backed up with an ELSE statement, which will be skipped over if the IF statement line is True. A variable is used to store a certain shape so that you can move it around in the future. I created a fishing simulator game. It's one of my first python projects and I think it's a neat game. Simply move the mouse to move the hook to the fish, and try to catch all three! </p>
