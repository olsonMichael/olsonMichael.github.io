    <h1>Global Goals Awarness</h1>
    <p>These images shown below are my modernized views on the 17 global goals. For this project, I worked with a partner. My partner's name for this assignment was Samir Gillett. Samir did 2 of these images, and I did the other 2. We both worked on the global scholar seal together. My Global Goals I wanted to recreate were Zero Hunger, and Quality Education. I chose Zero Hunger because it always hurts me to see people with limited or no access to food, in real life and in movies. I also thought that originally, the Zero Hunger image looked bland, and should include a person in the image. For my second image I chose Quality Education. I chose this because I am thankful for the level of education I am able to receive, and I believe that everyone in the world should have access to the same level of education. I also believed that a school house represented education much better than a book and a pencil because a book and a pencil are not symbolic of education. When you look at this image, you think about a school, and then link it to education. </p>
