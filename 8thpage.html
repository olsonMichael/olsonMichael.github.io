<h1>Network Attacks</h1>
<p>This is my Network Attacks project. For this project we were assigned a partner and a certain Network Attack to research. My partner's name is Julien Dietz. Network Attcks are attacks on the internet that attempt to steal personal information from you such as a social security number or credit card information. Examples of specific attacks include Phishing and Denial of Service attacks. My specific attack I researched with my partner was an SQL Injection. </p>
