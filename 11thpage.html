<h1>Guitar Shop CMU Create Task Number 4</h1>
<p>This is my simulation of a guitar store. In this simulation an employee walks up to you and prompts you to pick a guitar off the wall and play it. This project introduced onStep. The onStep command tells something to happen automatically in the program without any input. In this project, the onStep is the employee walking up to you. The user is able to click on a guitar and the program will choose a random riff from the list, and will play a 10-30 second excerpt of the song's main riff. It will then ask if you want to purchase the guitar and will generate a random price for the guitar. I made the program accept only Yes, yes or YES so that the user can be 100% sure they want to purchase it. This program includes some of the most popular riffs from songs that are mostly forbidden to play in guitar stores due to how much the employees hear them played. </p>
