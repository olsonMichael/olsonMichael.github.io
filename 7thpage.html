    <h1>Internet Dilemmas-IPv6 </h1>
    <p>This is my Internet Dilemmas project. For this project I researched IPv6. IPv6 seemed super interesting to me because it allows uncomprehendable amounts of people on the internet, and allows them to communicate with each other. The Internet Protocol (IP) is a standard protocol used across every device connected to the internet. It allows for communication between different devices, and is not dependent on the users location since it is through the internet. It allows communication within seconds to another person or group of people. IPv6 was created to combat the rapid increase of devices connected to the internet. It allowed a lot more devices to be connected at once. This will help through the rapid population growth as it will allow more people to be connected and online.</p>

    <li>My first task was to provide some information about IPv6. My answer was "Internet Protocol version 6 or IPv6 is an IP addressing system that provides 3.4x10^38 addresses. IP is the address of your device to which is connected to the internet. The previous version of IP addresses 4,294,967,296 devices connected to the internet. The reason for the upgrade is the amount of new devices being connected".
</li>
<p> </p>
<li>My second task was to make a description of the design and purpose of IPv6, but make it simple enough for the average person to understand. My answer was "IPv6 is designed to address many more devices to the internet, allowing more internet devices around the planet. This is difficult because you would have to renumber every device in order to connect every device. This is the reason IPv6 is still in development, and why it will be necessary in the near future".</li>
<p> </p>
<li>My third task was to identify one beneficial, and one harmful effect of IPv6. My answer was "One benefit IPv6 has is that it provides IP addresses to the whole world and does not limit out at 4,294,967,296 devices connected to the internet. This will in the end assist the economy in the future when everyone is connected, however the cost and time the renumbering of every device takes a tremendous amount of time and money".</li>
<p> </p>
<li>My fourth and final task was to describe the data being used, describe how it consumes, produces, and transforms data; and at least one privacy concern. My answer was "Uses 128 bits for more addresses,
The IP address sends a message from itself to another IP address, 
Though there are many more digits, it is possible and somewhat simple to find someone's address and do malicious things with the IP address".</li>
