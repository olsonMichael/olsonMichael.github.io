<h1>AP Create Task</h1>
<p>This is my AP Create Task. This is the last creation we did this year. We had roughly 12 in class hours to complete this whole project. I chose to make a keyboard replica of the popular game guitar hero. The aim of the game is to hit as many notes as you can. This project was meant to be a demonstration of the full program, and includes the first 60 seconds of the song Welcome To The Jungle by Guns 'n Roses. I coded a title screen, song selection screen, and a guitar that has notes coming down it. You need to hit the key that the program tells you to hit when it crosses the large bar. Before playing this game, be warned of the extreme latency this causes.</p>
