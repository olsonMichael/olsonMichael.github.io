<h1>Cyber Security and Crime Data Breaches</h1>
<p>For this project I made a one-pager that talks about the JP Morgan Chase Bank data breach in 2014. This unit was all about cybersecurity and how to prevent these issues. My favorite part of this project was to develop an innovation that would help combat the problems I mentioned in the one pager. The one pager is below.</p>
<li>OVERVIEW:Some hackers broke into the JP Morgan Chase Bank servers and were able to view the phone numbers, names, and addresses of over 76 million people in 2014</li>
<p> </p>
<li>DATA SPECIFICS:The names and addresses of the people fell into the hands of the hackers
</li>
<p> </p>
<li>HOW IT WAS STOLEN/HOW TO PREVENT:The bleepingcomputer website says that it was a result of phishing. It was believed to be through emails. This is not a technological flaw because it is on the user to point out phishing emails. This can be prevented by carefully examining emails for typos and the wrong username. 
</li>
<p> </p>
<li>DATA PRIVACY/SECURITY CONCERNS:The hackers got access to addresses and phone numbers. There is no evidence that these data points were used, however personal information such as address and phone number should not be given out to strangers.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>ADDRESSING CONCERNS (innovation mentioned earlier):</li>
<li>Create an application that uses an ai to search the internet for the email address you received the message from, and then if the internet says that this is not a real email address, then the program will tell you with a pop-up that this is not a secure email due to factors such as X number of typos, and to many letters in the email address. 
</li>
<li>This will carefully examine the email, making sure the user does not accidentally hand over personal information to a fake email address.
</li>
