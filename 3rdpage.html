    <h1>Digital Scene</h1>
    <p>This is one of my favorite projects I have done. I drew an elk drinking water in the Rocky Mountains. I chose the Rocky Mountains because I recently visited Colorado, and I really enjoyed the scenery there. If you click the button to run the code, it will randomize the placement of the trees and mountains in the background. This represents a random scene of the Rocky Mountains each time, which I think is a great usage of the random number generator.</p>
