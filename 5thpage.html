    <h1>Data Story</h1>
    <p>It's not really a story, but it is an analyzation of data. This analyzation helped me understand the data more. The data I analyzed is food calories in fried chicken from different fried chicken vendors. I narrowed the values down to just fried chicken because fried chicken is one of my favorite foods, and is one I order from a lot of different fast food places. I created a table to accurately represent the calories, as they are very close together. This chart works best because there are many individual values close together. Some new insights from this information that can be formed are Kfcâ€™s business would go down because people will find out they have the most high calories in a single item. After a while, KFC will rebound because people will recognize the lowest calorie item is also from KFC. Business from Chick-Fil-A would go up because they have a fairly low calorie item. Popeyes would stay the same due to the large spread of values. Since other vendors are not listed as a name, they will neither gain nor lose business. The rest of these vendors will stay roughly the same because they have values that are mostly in the middle. People such as adults will make decisions on where to eat based on the calorie count of a certain item, in order to eat more healthy. After people look at this visualization they will have an easier time deciding where to get fried chicken from if they are trying to stay on a more low calorie diet.
