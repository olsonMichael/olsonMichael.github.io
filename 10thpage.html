<h1>Fundraising App CMU Create Task Number 3</h1>
<p>This is my Fundraising App for Quality Education. Quality Education is the fourth of 17 global goals. This global goal focuses on giving everyone a quality education, and to promote lifelong learning. I chose Quality Education as my goal because I value education a lot, and I think it's important to promote learning for everyone in order to educate the society. This App required a List, and a loop, along with the requirements of the previous create task. A List is something that stores many pieces of data, as in numbers or pieces of text which are called strings; or many shapes. This can be used for calculations, random selection, and many other things. A loop is something that is called in order to repeat something multiple times in a row. For example, if you want to draw 20 circles, instead of manually inputing 20 circle commands, you can use the loop to repeat the circle drawing 20 times. I used the loop to draw books on the second page of my app. A single book would be drawn for every 5 dollars donated. Before running the program, expect large program delays for any donations above 2000 dollars. DISCLAIMER: This program is fake and no money is actually donated.</p>
