<h1>Project 0:Innovation Simulation</h1>
<p>This is the very first project I did in my AP Computer Science Principles class. It was a project that had the goal to come up with one innovation that would be helpful to schools around the world. This would have to budget, and was supposed to be beneficial. I was assigned a group to work with on the project. My group members were Ian Krupnik, Chelsea Lim, and Roman Stukov. We made a video and a one pager. The video and the sources will be linked, while the information from my one page is found below.The heading above the bullet points represents an innovation's name. I had 2 ideas for innovations. </p>
<h2>Earbud Speakers</h2>
<li>PURPOSE- This exists in order to counter the fact that so many kids are wearing earbuds during class and are not able to hear the teacher. Wearing earbuds helps kids with focus and easing stress. So being able to go through any pair of earbuds whilst students can still hear their music could improve focus and anxiety during class.
</li>
<li>FUNCTION-There would be an antenna and a microphone. Everytime you speak into the microphone, the antenna releases radio waves which infiltrate the speakers of bluetooth earbuds and headphones automatically lowering the volume by 4 volume levels, and then the bluetooth device would play the sound inputted in the microphone.
</li>
<li>WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED-
Percentage increase of grades,
Percentage increase of focus,
Percentage increase of work completed,
How happy everyone is, and the
Comfort of students
</li>
<li>WHY I WOULD RECOMMEND-I would recommend this computing innovation because It allows students who enjoy music to listen to music even during class time while effectively listening to the lecture. If a student does statistically better with listening to music, there should be no reason to disapprove the usage of music in the classroom setting if it helps them. This device will solve the problem for teachers who hate bluetooth devices in their class and students who love listening to music while working.

<h3>GPS System</h3>
<li>PURPOSE-If schools want to save money, they should reconsider making their building a lot larger in order to house more students. If the school is larger, then there will be more classes. If there are more classes, they are harder to locate around the school. A GPS system will help the students and staff find their classes.
</li>
<li>FUNCTION-Each room will have a microchip meant for tracking. Each one of these chips will have an address in accordance with the room number. You type in the number in the GPS system and it will bring you to the location.
</li>
<li>WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED-Percentage of students showing up on time, and 
Accuracy of GPS
</li>
<li>WHY I WOULD RECOMMEND-I would recommend this computing innovation because It will save money for the school district if all of the students can be contained in one school. A larger school would require a GPS system to locate rooms in such a large building.
