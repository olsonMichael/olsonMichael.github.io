  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! I am Michael Olson. I am in sixth period AP Computer Science Principles. Some of my hobbies include fishing and playing the guitar. I enjoy watching professional sports while at home, as well as playing a few videogames. I am really enjoying computer science and my favorite part is getting to work hard on coding images on websites such as Code.org and CMU.edu. I currently live in Illinois, and attending high school, and I am excited to showcase some of my uses of Computer Science.</p>
